I'm not sure how to export a database table to be uploaded for GitHub. 

I have supplied the SQL statements required to build the database and table within.
I have also supplied a sample of records that are created and held in the database.

The MySQL database during development was configured to use user "root" with password "URLShortener"

Hope this doesn't cause any issues.
